### *Matthew Fam*

Miscellaneous code samples from past projects (2019-2024).

What is this?
==
This is a repository meant to demonstrate my data science and software engineering skills, as they have developed with time and practice. Related projects and code may also be found at [matthewfam.com](https://www.matthewfam.com).

The samples cover my background in data engineering (i.e., file manipulation, data extraction, API interactions), data science (i.e., data clean-up/processing/wrangling, data analysis, and data visualization), and web development (i.e., frontend and UX). They include advanced statistics, machine learning, and parallelization/concurrency.

Though much of my latest (and best) work happens to be proprietary, I am working on a library that better represents my current skill set. A portion of this Python library has been condensed into one [multi-purpose module and script for interacting with APIs](Python/Data%20Extraction/http_request_experiment.py). For the past few years, I have used Python more than any other lanuage. However, you may also be interested in viewing the following work, completed with R:
